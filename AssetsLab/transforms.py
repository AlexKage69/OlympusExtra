        In general, you want to apply a transformation to an entire image.
        But in the special case where you know that the image is all one color,
        you can save cycles by just applying the transformation to that color
        and then constructing an image of the desired size.

        For example, in the result of the following code,
        image1 and image2 should be identical:

            rgbt = create_some_rgb_tranform()

        the first three channels will be interpreted as RGB,
