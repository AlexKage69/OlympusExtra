# OlympusExtra

OlympusExtra is a Hades DLC mod which adds new gods and boons to the Hades game. This includes unique effects, god's curses, duo boons, voicelines, and more. 

We are planning the following 4 Olympian Gods: Apollo, Hestia, Hera and Hephastus.

## Disclaimer!

**YOUR SAVE FILES MAY BE CORRUPTED IF MODDED WRONGLY! PLEASE CREATE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVE FILES IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR PROGRESS**

Do note that we're still in beta-testing phase for OlympusExtra, so please note that it is very possible that your Hades game might crash during the process. To avoid this, please create a backup of the game by copying the Hades game save file before making any modifications! Your save file can be found under `Documents\Saved Games\Hades`.

In the event that the game crashes and cannot be restored, you can replace this with the backup which you have copied. Alternatively, for Steam users, you can also go to `Library` > Right click Hades > `Properties` > `Local Files` > `Verify integrity of game files`

Please also note that not all features have been fully implemented yet, and some may still be buggy. We welcome your feedback on the [Hades Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/D8S4hjABaM)
