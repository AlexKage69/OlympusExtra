# OlympusExtra

OlympusExtra is a fan-made DLC mod which adds new gods, boons, and other additional content to *Hades* by Supergiant Games. This includes unique effects, gods' curses, duo boons, art, voicelines, and so much more!

Our current release includes Apollo and Hestia, and we are working on Hera and Hephastus for upcoming releases. We've also added a companion summon for Cerberus, and are planning additional weapons, NPCs, and much moreâ€”stay tuned here, at [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/123), or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OlympusExtra).

** **If you have already installed OlympusExtra and are updating it, please note that all releases from v1.1.0 on require the latest version of modimporter!** **


-----------------------------
## Disclaimer!

_**YOUR SAVE FILES MAY BE CORRUPTED IF YOUR GAME IS MODDED INCORRECTLY! PLEASE CREATE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVE FILES BEFORE INSTALLING ANY MODS IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR PROGRESS!**_

To create a backup of your save files, copy everything inside the `Documents\Saved Games\Hades` folder, and paste it in a safe place that you can restore from in case of file corruption or crashes. In the event that the game crashes and cannot be restored, you can replace the files in that folder with the backup which you have copied. Alternatively, for Steam users, you can also go to `Library` > Right-click on *Hades* > `Properties` > `Local Files` > `Verify integrity of game files`.

**Please note that OlympusExtra is still in beta testing**, so it is very possible that your *Hades* game might crash during play, or otherwise behave in an unexpected manner. We have run our own debugging and testing as best we can before any release, but we can't always catch every potential issue. Additionally, not all features have been fully implemented yet, and some may still be buggy. We welcome your feedback and bug reports on the [Hades Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/D8S4hjABaM), or as repo Issues here on Git.


-----------------------------
## Locating Your *Hades* Game Folder For Modding
- **Steam**: `Library` > Right-click on *Hades* > `Manage` > `Browse local files` 
- **Epic Games**: Go to `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Hades`

-----------------------------
## Pre-Requisites 
1. You will need the latest version of [modimporter](https://github.com/SGG-Modding/sgg-mod-modimporter/releases/). If needed, installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/26). 

2. You'll also need the latest version of [Mod Utility](https://github.com/SGG-Modding/sgg-mod-modutil/releases/). Place the unzipped contents in the `Hades\Content\Mods` folder. (If the `Mods` folder does not yet exist, it should be created.)

3. If you are using the CodexMenu mod, please make sure you have the latest version, since OlympusExtra is only compatible with CodexMenu v2.5.1 or later. You might need to take CodexMenu.lua from [here](https://github.com/PonyWarrior/HadesModRepo/tree/master/CodexMenu) if it's not updated on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/15).
   

-----------------------------
## Installation Instructions
1. Make sure you fulfill the above pre-requisites. (You should have the **latest version** of all pre-reqs listed above, or else the mod installation will have errors!)
2. Download the most recent OlympusExtra mod from the [Releases](https://github.com/AlexKage69/OlympusExtra/releases) section; be sure to also download the `VO.fsb` file.
3. Place the unzipped contents in the `Hades\Content\Mods` folder. (If the `Mods` folder does not yet exist, it should be created.) `VO.fsb` should go inside the `OlympusExtra\Audio` folder.
4. Run the `Hades\Content\modimporter.exe` executable.
5. Open *Hades* and start playing!

## Common Mistakes
- When installing the mod, make sure the name of the folder it's in is `OlympusExtra`, inside the `Mods` folder.
- Always make sure you have the latest version of *OlympusExtra*, *ModUtil* and *modimporter*. We work very closely, and try to always make sure all three of our respective releases are compatible with the most recent versions of the other two.
